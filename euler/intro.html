  This is an HTML file. You can edit this by opening it up in Sublime
  and view what it does by opening it in a browser like Chrome. There are
  other ways to run raw javascript, but javascript got its start in the browser
  so it's probably the easiest way to go if you don't want to have to install
  anything like node.js to run javascript directly. Plus you can practice some
  HTML stuff too. Never hurts.

  Specific steps:
  - Pull in this pull request
  - Pull the changes down to your local computer
  - Open the fat-julio project in finder and drag a .html file to Chrome to
    view it
  - Also open the folder in Sublime and try making some changes to the file
    you're viewing
  - Reload the page in Chrome to see what your changes did

  You don't actually need iTerm in the mix yet if you're working in the browser.

  This is just some basic HTML. You probably want to start off with a template
  something like this for your other pages.
-->
<html>
  <!--
    The head section is where meta-information like the page title, language,
    css stylesheets and links to external javascript files go.

    For instance:
  -->
  <head>
    <title>Intro to in-browser Javascript</title>
  </head>

  <!-- The body section is for the actual content of the page -->
  <body>
    <h1>Yo</h1>
    <p id="text">Here is a paragraph with id set to text</p>

    <!--
      This is some javascript. Usually this would be in another file, but this
      is fine getting started.
    -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var answer = 1 + 1;
      alert("You can display information by alerting it: 1 + 1 = " + answer);

      document.getElementById("text").innerHTML =
        "You can also display information by using javascript to change HTML"
    </script>
  </body>
</script>
